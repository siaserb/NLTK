At three  o'clock 12/05/1895 precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not
yet returned (005)-456-34-23. The landlady informed me that he baker_street@here.uk had left the house
shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down beside the
fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him,, however long he
might be. 145 124 245 I was already 67-56-34 deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though
it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which
were Watson3@gmail.com associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded,
still, the nature of  the case and the exalted station of his client
gave it a character of its own 1896/01/23.. Indeed, apart from the nature of the
investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his
masterly 5618 4582 8225 1471 grasp of a situation, and his (03)-8-45-34 keen, incisive reasoning, which
made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the
quick, subtle 4987 1514 6555 4212 methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable
mysteries. So accustomed was I ShHolmes@mail.uk to his invariable success that the very
possibility of his failing  had ceased to enter into my head.
